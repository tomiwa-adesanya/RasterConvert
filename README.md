## Description

RasterConvert is a Windows OS application that can be used to convert Raster image from one file format to another. 

Raster images are images compiled using pixels, or tiny dots, containing unique color and tonal information that come together to create the image.
Examples of raster image file formats include PNG, TIFF, DIB, JPEG, GIF, EPS e.t.c.   

Raster images file format formats supported by RasterConvert are:
  * PNG (Portable Network Graphics)
  * JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group)
  * ICO (Windows Icon)
  * TIFF (Tag Image File Format)
  * DIB (Device Independent Bitmap)
  * GIF (Graphics Interchange Format)

RasterConvert also maintains image transparency in file formats that support transparent background like PNG, TIFF, GIF, ICO.

## Working with the source code(Python programmers)

RasterConvert was written in Python, and the source code to this project can be found [here](/main.py)

Source code requirments:  

   * Windows OS.
   * Python version 3.9 or higher.
   * Python third party library `PIL`.
        * To install `PIL`, in your Windows terminal enter `pip install pillow`.
   * An IDE, preferably VS-Code or PyCharm
   
 Clone this repository unto your computer, and run *main.py*. 
 
 ## Installing and running RasterConvert(Non Python Programmers)
 
 For non-programmers, I have compiled a setup that may be used to install this application in your computer, and I have also compiled a standalone executable that
 doesn't require installation to use software.
